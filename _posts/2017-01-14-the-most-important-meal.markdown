>  **I Peter 2:2**: *"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby..."*

I am not one for cutesy titles, but this common statement about breakfast jumped out at me, as I was about my normal morning routine. Breakfast, it has been said, is the most important meal of the day. I have heard it all my life, agree that it is important, and try to never miss it myself.

However, the believer in Jesus Christ ought to consider, and agree, that breakfast is not the most important meal of the day. Instead, our daily feasting upon the milk, meat, and bread of God’s Word is easily our most important meal! Without regular study, our spiritual lives waste away, and God looks down with disapproval (II Tim 2:15). Without regular consumption, we will not grow spiritually (I Peter 2:2). If we do not grow spiritually, we will not bear forth the fruit of the Spirit (Psalm 1:1-3), or be able to stand firm amidst Satan’s attacks (Eph 6:10-17; I John 2:14). If we cannot do these things, we will eventually wither, and become consumed by the world, flesh, and devil (Matthew 13:3-9; I Peter 5:8)

Friends, it is hard for many people to make time for breakfast, amidst their busy schedules. It is even harder for many believers to make time to consume God’s Word, but we must!

How is your Bible reading? Have you read your Bible today? Do you take time to feed yourself, so that you can grow spiritually? These things are necessary! If you need help, please contact your pastor today.
