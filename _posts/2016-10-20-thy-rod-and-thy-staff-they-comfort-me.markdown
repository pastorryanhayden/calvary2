>  **Psalm 23:4**: *"...thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."*

Since preaching it earlier this week, I cannot get this statement off of my mind. It continues to comfort and convict: all at the same time. David wrote the 23rd psalm with the understanding of a shepherd, and inspiration of the Spirit of God. He makes several very profound statements and gives very specific promises.

The foundation of this psalm is that believers in Jesus Christ are God's sheep, while the Lord Jesus is our Shepherd (John 10:11-16). However, our God gives us a free will, with which we can choose who is going to do the leading and following (Romans 14:1-12). If believers choose to die to their flesh (putting off the old man), and be filled with God's Spirit, we are actively telling God that He must be our Shepherd, while we will follow, as His sheep. This requires active humility and decision making.

This being the case, when we make Christ to be our Shepherd, He gives certain promises to His sheep, and His sheep, in turn, respond in certain ways. David states that, as God's sheep, the Shepherd's rod and staff comfort him. 

A middle-eastern shepherd of David's day had two implements: a rod and staff, with which he primarily worked. The rod was a club-like object, while the staff was similar to a walking stick with a crook on it. We are probably more familiar with the latter than the former.

The rod (club) was a necessary tool for the shepherd. It was used for defense against wolves, bears, and other predators. The shepherd would learn to throw it with great accuracy. God gives us His Word as one of our spiritual weapons with which we can avoid the attacks of our adversary (Eph 6:17), the Devil (I Peter 5:8). Whenever Satan attacks, a Bible verse exists that will send him fleeing away. This is exactly what the Lord Jesus did, when He was tempted in the wilderness (Matt 4:1-11)! The key for us is learning to use the Word well, so that we can wield it accurately. This takes time, study, and work (II Tim 2:15)!

In addition, the club was used for discipline. Sheep are not very smart animals. In fact, they are dumb animals that easily become dirty, lost, and injured in various ways. As God's sheep, we are the same. This is why humility is needed to place the Lord as our Shepherd, and us as His sheep! The rod (club) was used by the shepherd to throw at an unruly sheep: whether it was causing a ruckus in the flock, going to eat a poisonous plant, or wandering away from the fold. A well-aimed throw would send the errant animal hustling back to the safety of the flock.

At times, God has to correct His sheep, as they are also His children. In order to do this, He gives us the scriptures to point out what is, and is not, sinful. In addition, He sometimes has to take a hands-on approach, to show us when we are going down the wrong path. Some today do not believe that God would discipline His children, but the scriptures clearly state that it is an active part of His parenting (Heb 12:5-13). God does not discipline us out of cruelty or to be abusive. Instead, it is an aspect of His love toward us, in that He wants us to stay within the flock, and not wander astray into the world. He does not want us to consume the poisonous plants of sin, or be consumed by our adversary, the Devil! Effective discipline is never joyous, but is good for us, so that we will not come to ruin.

Finally, the rod (club) was used for examination. The flock would come back to the fold, and, as he counted the sheep, the shepherd would use the rod to part the wool of each one, to look for disease or injury. This shows us God's care and love. He does not want to be a hap-hazard Shepherd, but one that cares for each of His sheep. Again, this is why He gave us His Word. Only the scriptures are able to examine the life of a believer, and confirm us in righteousness, or convict us of sin (Heb 4:12). It alone is the judge of our lives, and the standard by which we must live. Therefore, if the Word reveals a spiritual infection within us, we must be careful to take care of it through repentance and restoration (I John 1:9).

Next, we come to the staff. The staff was a crooked, long piece of wood that aided the shepherd in many ways. One use was to provide another form of defense against enemies. Another was allowing the shepherd to lean upon it, as he watched over the flock. In respect to the sheep, the staff also had its uses.

One major use of the staff was to grab the sheep. The staff became an extension of the shepherd's arm. While the rod (club) was a throwing object, the staff was a reaching one. If a sheep fell off a cliff, the shepherd could retrieve it with his staff. If a sheep became entangled in thorns, the staff could be used to disentangle it. 

Some people have likened the club to the Word of God, and the staff to God's Spirit. In many ways, this makes sense. God's Spirit is that which reaches out to the world and believers alike. We are told that the Spirit of God reproves the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:7-11). This is true, and needed, for both the saved and unsaved. The saved need to be reproved of sin, to guide us toward a holy life. We need reproved of righteousness, to show us the right way to live, and of judgment, to declare the reality of the Judgment Seat of Christ (Rom 14:10)!

For the unsaved, the Spirit reproves them of sin, to show them their need of a Savior. He reproves of righteousness, to reveal the righteousness of Christ, and of judgment, to declare the reality of eternal judgment in Hell for those that reject Him. Both groups need the reproof, though in different ways.

In addition, as the shepherd's staff disentangles the sheep from the thorns, so does the Spirit help the believer to be disentangled from the world. Jesus tells us that believers are in the world, but not of it (John 17:9-17). Our residence is Heaven, not Earth, though we are on this planet to do Christ's work. Therefore, we need the Spirit's help to become ever disentangled from the thorns of this world, so that we can serve God better (II Tim 2:3-4). This is a slow process that requires faithfulness, but is God's will for every believer.

"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." With the above implications, can you imagine David making such a statement? He is effectively stating that the Shepherd's protection and restoration are comforting. But, he is also declaring that the Shepherd's correction and examination comfort his heart. Many today want the God of Love, but not the One that is also holy and just. We cannot have one without the others! To create God in our own image, according to our preferences, is to create a false god, and not proclaim the True God of the Bible!

How about you? Have you submitted to being God's sheep: making Christ your Shepherd? If you have done so, do you see His rod and staff as comforting or grievous? If you draw close to Him, the Word and Spirit will show you how great of a Shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ truly is!
