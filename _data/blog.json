		"body_content": "For most people, transitioning between their stages of life can be very difficult. I was visiting with an elderly lady who had just recently lost her husband. I believe they had been married for sixty-four years! This dear soul is having to adjust to living alone and taking care of things all by herself. Praise the Lord, her family and her church family/friends are close by. This transition for her is not easy, and it's not for us either. Being without a pastor is hard, but we know during this difficult time, that God still is in control and has a wonderful plan for us. How can we know this? It says in First Thessalonians 5:18, In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.  See? This is God's will for us right now, and someday we will understand it better. Praise the Lord!",
