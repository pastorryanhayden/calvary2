This emotional coming-of-age story follows Owen as he graduates to adulthood and takes his first steps toward independence.\n\nThe subject of his father (Wilmington native) Ron Suskind’s New York Times bestseller, Owen was a thriving three year old who suddenly and inexplicably went silent – and for years after remained unable to connect with other people or to convey his thoughts, feelings or desires.\n\nLife, Animated evocatively interweaves classic Disney sequences with verite scenes from Owen’s life in order to explore how his identification and empathy for characters like Simba, Jafar, and Ariel gave him a means to understand his feelings and allowed him to interpret reality. Beautiful, original animations offer rich insights into Owen’s fruitful dialogue with the Disney oeuvre as he imagines himself heroically facing adversity as a member in a tribe of sidekicks. Owen’s story is a moving testament to the many ways in which stories can serve as a means of persevering through the dark times, leading us all toward the light.\n\n## Awards\n\nAcademy Awards, USA, 2016- Nomination, Documentary Feature\n\nSundance Film Festival, USA, 2016- Directing Award- US Filmmaker","genre":["Documentary"],"starring":"Owen Suskind, Ron Suskind","short_description":"A boy who does not speak, and his family, discover a unique way to communicate by immersing themselves in the world of classic Disney animated films.

As he repeatedly declares, gone are the days of all-Caucasian casts, lousy stage facilities, and instructional brow-beating. For Millepied, modernization is vital in order to keep the establishment relevant, both with audiences and with dancers who, in his opinion, are too often taught to be robotic clones by abusive teachers.\n\nWith appearances by composer Nico Muhly, Opera alumna Aurélie Dupont, and designer Iris van Herpen, RESET is a delightfully aesthetic affair from filmmakers Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai, a moving portrait of a landmark moment for one of the ballet’s oldest institutions and one of its brightest new stars, both on the cusp of great transition.\n\n## Reviews:\n\nNew York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/movies/reset-review-benjamin-millepied.html?em_pos=small\u0026emc=edit_fm_20170113\u0026nl=movies-update\u0026nl_art=3\u0026nlid=71725069\u0026ref=headline\u0026te=1\u0026_r=0","genre":["Documentary"],"starring":"Benjamin Millepied, Nico Muhly, Aurélie Dupont, Iris van Herpen","short_description":"Reset is a moving portrait of a landmark moment for one of the ballet’s oldest institutions and one of its brightest new stars, both on the cusp of great transition.","weekend_at":"2017-03-10","director":"Benjamin Millepied","showtimes":"FRI 2 | SAT 7:30 | SUN 3","length":110,"rating":"Not Rated","format":"digital","rotten_tomatoes":100,"thumbnail_image":[{"id":"attXAKdpdil4DaWNX","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/QdWacSH6RpiPnXer7Ryo_reset-millepied-in-studio.jpg","filename":"reset-millepied-in-studio.jpg","size":90409,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ZFjhbT4xTkimUDibuF2k_small_reset-millepied-in-studio.jpg","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/BrXdHadVQjG0WdmrNx7d_large_reset-millepied-in-studio.jpg","width":512,"height":512}}}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7O2KwPOCRI","live?":true,"id":"recN0yB7Q6cMUCJy2"},{"title":"My Life as a Zucchini","notes":"After his mother’s sudden death, Zucchini is befriended by a police officer, Raymond, who accompanies him to his new foster home, filled with other orphans his age.
